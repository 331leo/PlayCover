# PlayCover
Run iOS apps & games on M1 Mac with mouse, keyboard and controller support.

Intel macs support will be implemented later.

# Installation

Just build last commit version or download last installer from Releases tab.

On first launch, app will prompt you to install Xcode Tools. Agree, please.

Now you can simply drag & drop any .ipa from iMazing, M1 Checker or AppDb.

Wait till PlayCover will convert app and launch it.

# How to create key mapping

Press Ctrl + P to open editor mode.

Now you can use Ctrl + N to add button, Ctrl + J - joystick, Ctrl + M - mouse.

To delete a key, click on existing button, and then press Ctrl + Del.

After edit, just press Ctrl + P again to save results.

You can hold Alt during game to stop mouse camera control.
