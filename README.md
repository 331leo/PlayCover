# PlayCover
Run iOS apps & games on M1 Mac with mouse, keyboard and controller support. 
Intel macs support will be implemented later.

# Installation

Just build last commit version or download last from Releases tab.
On first launch, app will prompt you to install Xcode Tools. Agree, please.
Now you can simply drag & drop any .ipa from iMazing, M1 Checker or AppDb.
Wait till PlayCover will convert app and launch it.
